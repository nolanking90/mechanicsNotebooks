# Near Integrability of the Double Pendulum at Suff. Large Energies
----

For large kinetic energies, acceleration due to gravity is a small perturbation
of a completely integrable system. 

In these notes we show
- The free double pendulum is completely integrable.
- By Routh Reduction, we find an effective potential function, and show there are
three distinct motions describing all solutions of the system. 
- We find a canonical transformation that puts the system into a form
demonstrating the near integrability (without passing to action-angle
coordinates).

# TODO:
- The free double pendulum has a homoclinic orbit. Use Poincare-Melnikov method
  to show there is a Smale Horeshoe map.
- (Unrelated) Show if the Hamiltonain (in R^2) is real-analytic, then the action
  as a function of the energy is also real analytic.
